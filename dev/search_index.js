These can store both features and targets.  Values of the DMatrix can be accessed as with any other AbstractMatrix, however doing so causes additional allocations.  Performant indexing and matrix operation code should not use DMatrix directly.\n\nAside from a primary array, the DMatrix object can have various \"info\" fields associated with it. Training target variables are stored as a special info field with the name label, see setinfo! and setinfos!.  These can be retrieved with getinfo and getlabel.\n\nNote that the xgboost library internally uses Float32 to represent all data, so input data is automatically copied unless provided in this format.  Unfortunately because of the different representations used by C and Julia, any non Transpose matrix will also be copied.\n\nOn missing Values\n\nXgboost supports training on missing data.  Such data is simply omitted from tree splits.  Because the DMatrix is internally a Float32 matrix, libxgboost uses a settable default value to represent missing values, see the missing_value keyword argument below (default NaN32).  This value is used only on matrix construction.  This will cause input matrix elements to ultimately be converted to missing.  The most obvious consequence of this is that NaN32 values will automatically be converted to missing with default arguments.  The provided constructors ensure that missing values will be preserved.\n\nTL;DR: DMatrix supports missing and NaN's will be converted to missing.\n\nConstructors\n\nDMatrix(X::AbstractMatrix; kw...)\nDMatrix(X::AbstractMatrix, y::AbstractVector; kw...)\nDMatrix((X, y); kw...)\nDMatrix(tbl; kw...)\nDMatrix(tbl, y; kw...)\nDMatrix(tbl, yname::Symbol; kw...)\n\nArguments\n\nX: A matrix that is the primary data wrapped by the DMatrix.  Elements can be missing.   Matrices with Float32 eleemnts do not need to be copied.\ny: Data to assign to the label info field.  This is the target variable used in training.   Can also be set with the label keyword.\ntbl: The input matrix in tabular form.  tbl must satisfy the Tables.jl interface.   If data is passed in tabular form feature names will be set automatically but can   be overriden with the keyword argument.\nyname: If passed a tabular argument tbl, yname is the name of the column which holds the   label data.  It will automatically be omitted from the features.\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\nmissing_value: The Float32 value of elements of input data to be interpreted as missing,   defaults to NaN32.\nlabel: Training target data, this is the same as the y argument above, i.e.   DMatrix(X,y) and DMatrix(X, label=y) are equivalent.\nweight: An AbstractVector of weights for each data point.  This array must have lenght   equal to the number of rows of the main data matrix.\nbase_margin: Sets the global bias for a boosted model trained on this dataset, see   https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/prediction.html#base-margin\n\nExamples\n\n(X, y) = (randn(10,3), randn(10))\n\n# the following are all equivalent\nDMatrix(X, y)\nDMatrix((X, y))\nDMatrix(X, label=y)\n\nDMatrix(X, y, feature_names=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"])  # explicitly set feature names\n\ndf = DataFrame(A=randn(10), B=randn(10))\nDMatrix(df)  # has feature names [\"A\", \"B\"] but no label\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/#XGBoost.load-Tuple{Type{DMatrix}, AbstractString}","page":"API","title":"XGBoost.load","text":"load(DMatrix, fname; silent=true, kw...)\n\nLoad a DMatrix from file with name fname.
